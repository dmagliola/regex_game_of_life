# "Regex implementation" of Game of Life, v2 (full Regex!)
#
# This version uses a Mega-Regex to find all the cells that need to change,
# and it captures a neighbour of the opposite value to be able to flip the cells
# using pure Regex.
#
# When run, this will output the mega-regex it's using to `mega_regex.txt`,
# so you can see what it's doing, then run the game based on that Regex.

# "Board" helpers, mostly to deal with loading from files, and printing to screen.
# In "Regex game of life", we're representing the board as linear string of 0's and 1's

  # Loads an input pattern of 0's and 1's to use as an initial board
